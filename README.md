## IdFive Web Site ##
**IdFive Web Site** is a web site that I did as an admission test.

## Installation ##

First of all, this app was created with **NodeJS 8.4.0** and **Express 4.15.0**.

After you have cloned the project, go inside the folder a run `npm install`.

Once done, you can start the server with `npm start`

If you see an error after run `npm start` try running `npm rebuild node-sass --force`, for some reason there is a problem with this dependecie but it's easy to solve.

## Some screenshots ##

Here are some screenshot of the web site.
